        <p>For as long as humanity has existed, art has been part of our lives. For many years, people have been creating and enjoying art.  It expresses emotions or expression of life. It is one such creation that enables interpretation of any kind.

            It is a skill that applies to music, painting, poetry, dance and more. Moreover, nature is no less than art. For instance, if nature creates something unique, it is also art. Artists use their artwork for passing along their feelings.
            
            Thus, art and artists bring value to society and have been doing so throughout history. Art gives us an innovative way to view the world or society around us. Most important thing is that it lets us interpret it on our own individual experiences and associations.
            
            Art is similar to live which has many definitions and examples. What is constant is that art is not perfect or does not revolve around perfection. It is something that continues growing and developing to express emotions, thoughts and human capacities.

            <p>As we know that Art is a technique to express some certain emotions to bind ourselves in the root. If we go back five thousand or more than five thousand, we find that Art had an integral role not only in expressing emotions or ideas but the development of the mankind.

                There are lots of painting which we have found on the walls of ancient caves or milestones which directly give the clues that tribal communities painted the paintings whether on the walls or milestones to keep them safe for next generation.
